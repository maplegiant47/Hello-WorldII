<h1 class="green-text">Hello World! (II)<h1>
<p class="green-text">This project is a work of practice, a work of curiosity and, one could say, intrigue.
Why? Because I want to get together many different lyrics to many different good songs, and I want to get their translations too.
This is going to be, I can hope, a good place for keep the proper tanslations of good songs.
If I get good at this, I plan on including the actual songs themselves too, and any attached videos I can get.
Maybe I'll post my own poetry from time to time, this is a personal work after all.</p>
